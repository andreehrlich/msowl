# The variables `Z1` and `Z2` are covariates/features to be used for tailoring treatment to individuals. 
# Estimation of an optimal individual treatment rule for prolonging the time spent in State 2 based on a linear decision function and considering the process up to time Ï„ = 3 can be performed as follows:

fit <- itr(

  w = c(0, 1, 0), 
  tau = 3, 
  lambda=1, 
  kernel="linear",

# Estimation of the the value function of the latter estimated optimal treatment rule and its standard error using the function `V_d` can be performed as follows:

# Estimation of the the value function of the fixed rule that assigns treatment 1 to everyone, along with its standard error, can be performed as follows:

print(paste("Value of Treatment 1:", res$pos[1], "+/-", res$pos[2]))

# Estimation of the the value function of the fixed rule that assigns treatment -1 to everyone, along with its standard error, can be performed as follows:
